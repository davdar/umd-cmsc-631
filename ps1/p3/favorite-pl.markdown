Do you feel inferior in your programming job?

\noindent
Are other alpha-male nerds getting you down?

\noindent
Look no further than the latest-and-greatest
wasn't-ever-intended-for-programming language that most people have never
heard of: __Coq__.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent
Be a true programming hipster douche-bag and tell everyone else why their
language sucks, and why one that sounds like a common term for genitalia is
better.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent
As a user of Coq you'll learn lots of fancy buzzwords and quip phrases that
make other programmer-bullies cower in admiration. _Type theory_.
_Curry-Howard_. _Dependent types_. _Adam Chlipala uses it_.

Next time some lay-person tells you "I built a website over the weekend and
plan to launch a startup!", you can reply, "Nobody cares grandpa. I spent over
20 hours yesterday formalizing basic arithmetic in Coq--Get a real job!"

Decide today to learn Coq and liven up the water-cooler discussion at your
workplace. Start by visiting this obscure looking French website:
https://coq.inria.fr. Become a hero, and always be "that-guy" who won't shut up
about his favorite programming language. Do it for science.
